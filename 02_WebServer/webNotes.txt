what is Server?
A server is basically a computer or a system that provides services, data, or resources to other
computers, known as clients, over a network (like the Internet or a local network).

📌 Real-Life Example:
When you open Google.com:
-> Your device (the client) sends a request to Google’s server.
-> The server processes your request and sends the webpage back to your browser.

🌐 What is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)?
HTTP is a protocol — a set of rules — that defines how data is requested and transmitted over the 
web between clients (browsers/apps) and servers.
It’s like a language that allows communication between your browser and the web server.


🌐 What is an HTTP Request?
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (usually a browser or an app) to a server asking for 
some resource or action over the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
✅ The client: The user’s web browser or application.
✅ The server: A machine or software that responds with the requested data.

📝 Basic Structure of an HTTP Request:
-> METHOD /path HTTP/version
-> Headers
(blank line)
-> Request Body (only for some types of requests)

🔑 Key Parts of an HTTP Request:
Part	                                   What It Means	                              Example

Body (optional)	                     Data you’re sending to the server	           { "name": "Abbad" }

🚀 Common HTTP Request Methods:

🔄 How HTTP Request Works (Step-by-Step):
1️⃣ Client (Browser or App) → Sends an HTTP Request.
2️⃣ Server → Receives the request, processes it.
3️⃣ Server → Sends back an HTTP Response (status + data).
4️⃣ Client → Displays or uses the response.

📊 Status Codes (in the Response):
Code	                Meaning
200	                 OK (Success)
201	              Created (POST success)
400	                  Bad Request
401                	Unauthorized
404	                    Not Found
500                	   Server Error
